# Step 10: Add support for power up pill

In this lesson you will learn how to:

- Use a timer 
- When and how to use a Mutex lock

## Overview

In this lesson we will be adding support for the power up pill to the application. We will update the configuration with the new setups and add code to draw the pill in the maze. We will also manage the process after pacman swallows a pill and collides with a ghost. Finally, we will manipulate cases where pacman tries to swallow a pill while the previous one is active and how to tackle this.
